- 👋 Hi, I’m @hak42
- 👀 I’m interested in robots, taking things apart, and learning new things. Not necessarily in that order.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to actually finish projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything creative! Especially if it engages people or opens people up to new ways of thinking. 
- 📫 How to reach me: tanya.hakala@proton.me
